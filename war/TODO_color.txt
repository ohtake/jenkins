18:35:23 <kohsuke> #topic Kohsuke wanted to discuss this (JENKINS-9488 - align topbar colors): https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/179
18:35:29 <rtyler> or that one
18:35:45 <kohsuke> #info so there's a pending request to change the color of the top bar of Jenkins UI
18:35:58 <jenkins-admin> JENKINS-9488:align color palette used in Jenkins with jenkins-ci.org and issues.jenkins-ci.org (Open) http://jenkins-ci.org/issue/9488
18:35:59 <aheritier> Funny 9488 : I remember having proposed it a long time ago in the chat.
18:35:59 <kohsuke> from current blue + orange to black + red, the same colors used in wiki and issues
18:36:09 <aheritier> +1 from me
18:36:41 <kohsuke> #info one point I'd like to make is that the current color came from the same palette that's used for all the other icons
18:36:42 <rtyler> I'm definitely on board, but the colors on the wiki are not pure black -_-
18:36:45 <aheritier> As it will be more coherent and it will make us a little bit different
18:37:02 * olamy tested the pull request and like it
18:37:05 <kohsuke> and the same color palette is used for hyperlinks, trend graphs, blue/red/yellow ball, etc.
18:37:16 <kohsuke> So I'm bit mixed about the change
18:37:26 <aheritier> kohsuke: the palette must be documented in the wiki
18:37:33 <rtyler> olamy: can you post a screenshot?'
18:37:38 <aheritier> and I agree we need to be sure to use it everywhere
18:37:56 <olamy> arf I have reverted locally
18:38:03 <jieryn> does this highlight a larger need for an easier to theme/skin jenkins?
18:38:38 <aheritier> I'm also interested in skinning capabilities but it is  a larger subject I think
18:38:38 <rtyler> jieryn: I don't think so, I think this is just a matter of our branding being woefully dated
18:38:46 <rtyler> (theming is a different can of worms)
18:39:14 <kohsuke> or does this mean we should look at changing other colors at the same time? The new palette uses different blue & red
18:39:43 <olamy> ahertiter: some company/organisations like to have their own design
18:40:14 <rtyler> kohsuke: we do have the color pallette up here: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Logo
18:40:19 <rtyler> IMHO it's definitely time to start using it
18:40:25 <jieryn> ..this is possibly the first literal bike-shedding in a software project i've ever seen..
18:40:35 <jieryn> we are literally debating colors
18:40:38 <rtyler> woot!
18:40:42 <kohsuke> And this is the one currently in use http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines
18:41:11 <rtyler> aha
18:42:22 <kohsuke> I'm fine either way but I was inclined to keep the current one
18:42:45 <jieryn> i'd prefer to keep the original one unless we're going to wholesale replace the ui for easy theming, via extension or whatever
18:44:02 <kohsuke> #info screenshot: http://postimage.org/image/2u9iq9v0k/
18:44:27 <rtyler> that looks good to me
18:44:42 <aheritier> +1 for me IF everything is updated (links â€¦)
18:44:48 <kutzi> like it, too
18:45:15 <kutzi> should we ask the users as they will be using it?
18:45:16 <rtyler> kohsuke: do you think imod might be open to expanding his commit a bit? :)
18:45:31 <kohsuke> doesn't hurt to ask
18:45:36 <rtyler> kutzi: that's an even scarier bike shedding opportunity
18:45:38 <rtyler> xD
18:45:52 <kohsuke> OK, let's ask him or others to push this effort bit further then
18:46:03 <kohsuke> If enough people care to do it and it happens, then we'll swap
18:46:13 <bap2000> aren't the links the browser default?
18:46:23 <kohsuke> bap2000: actually, no
18:46:46 <bap2000> ok - looks like it to me o_O
